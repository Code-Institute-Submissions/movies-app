# Movie API - Interactive Frontend Development.

This is a site in which a movie API has been used for the purpose of extracting movie details that are sort of throughout the entire project.

A live demo can be found here.(onclick)

# UX
The site allows the user to search for any movies of their choice by typing in their query directly into the search area. This allows the user to search by any keyword. Based on that query, movies will then pop up from which the user could choose from. Once the movies are displayed, the user can click on the movie of their choice and the movie details will be displayed in a modal. The users also have an option to search for movies by genre. From the dropdown menu, they can select whichever genre of their choice and the movies of that particular genre will display. With the genre search, they could also select the genre and proceed to type in the query for any movie under such a particular genre,(for example: select genre: say, Action. On the search bar, search for any action movie by name.) this option means that the user will narrow down the serch resealts to a minimum which will display only the genre and a query for that genre. The user also has the option to select movies based on either popularity, newest movies, vote count and by revenue. By using

# Features
The features are:
1. Search bar : The search bar allows the user to search for any movies of their choice by typing in their query directly into the search area. This allows the user to search by any keyword. Based on that query, movies will then pop up from which the user could choose from. Once the movies are displayed, the user can click on the movie of their choice and the movie details will be displayed in a modal

2.Search by genre: The users also have the option to search for movies by genre. From the dropdown menu, they can select whichever genre of their choice and the movies of that particular genre will display. There is an extended feature to the genre search which is to select the genre and proceed to type in the query for any movie under such a particular genre,(for example: select genre: say, Action. On the search bar, search for any action movie by name or keyword.) This option ensures that the user will narrow down the search results by way of displaying only the genre and query for that genre.

3. Search by catergory:

(a) Top 10 movies by popularity,

(b) Top 10 movies by vote count,

(c) Top 10 movies by revenue and lastly

(d) Top 10 newest movies

All these catergories ensures that the user does not have to spend time trying to figure out what or which movie to search for. In this catergory, only the top 10 from that catergory are shown therefore the user can select one movie at a time from each catergory and find out the movie details on a separate page.

4. Pagination and back to previous page: These features allows the user to go back to the previous page or to continue to the next page if the movie they are looking for is not displayed in the evry page that they are on.
